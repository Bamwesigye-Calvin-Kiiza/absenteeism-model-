## Absenteeism-model
### Overview
The Absenteeism Model is a predictive model designed to forecast employee absenteeism. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and make predictions about future instances of absenteeism. The model can be used by organizations to better understand and manage employee absenteeism, enabling them to plan and allocate resources more effectively.

### Features
The Absenteeism Model offers the following features:

Data Preprocessing: The model includes data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for training.
Machine Learning Algorithms: The model employs various machine learning algorithms, such as regression or classification models, to predict absenteeism based on input features.
Model Training: The model is trained on historical data to learn patterns and relationships between input features and absenteeism.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.
Prediction: Once trained, the model can make predictions on new data to forecast future instances of absenteeism.
Installation
To use the Absenteeism Model, follow these installation steps:

### Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Bamwesigye-Calvin-Kiiza/absenteeism-model.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your data: Ensure your data is in a suitable format and includes the necessary features.
Train the model: Execute the training script or notebook to train the absenteeism model on your data.
Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
